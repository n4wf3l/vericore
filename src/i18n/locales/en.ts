      {
        question: 'How quickly can you intervene?',
        answer: 'For emergencies: <strong>Within 1 hour</strong> within a 10 km radius around Jette (Brussels) • <strong>Within 50 minutes</strong> within a 10 km radius around Uccle.\nFor non-urgent interventions: within <strong>24 to 72 hours</strong>, depending on team availability.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Are the displayed prices final?',
        answer: 'No. The indicated amounts are given as an indication. They may vary according to the site area, technical complexity, equipment present and after technical audit. Promotional conditions or subscription benefits may also be applied.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is an on-site visit mandatory?',
        answer: 'Yes. A technical visit is systematically conducted to establish an accurate and fair quote. For initial estimates, an analysis based on photos can be performed, but the final inspection is always done on site before validation.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What does a maintenance contract include?',
        answer: 'Each subscription clearly specifies: ✔ the number of preventive visits • ✔ the number of included interventions • ✔ intervention times • ✔ rate advantages • ✔ monitoring tools.\nMajor works are subject to separate quotes, but their complete management (coordination, marking, organization, monitoring) can be ensured to limit impact on site activity.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is there a minimum commitment?',
        answer: 'We recommend an initial commitment of <strong>12 months</strong>, allowing optimization of prevention, planning and costs for the client. Formula adjustment is possible after 6 months according to changing needs.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What happens if I exceed the included quota?',
        answer: 'No problem. Additional interventions are billed separately with a <strong>preferential rate</strong> reserved for clients under contract.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you work with property managers and building administrators?',
        answer: 'Yes. We daily support property managers, administrators, businesses and real estate investors in the technical management of their buildings.'
      },
      {
        question: 'In which areas do you intervene?',
        answer: 'We intervene throughout Belgium, with operational bases in Brussels.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Are you insured and certified?',
        answer: 'Yes. Our teams are covered by mandatory professional insurance and work in compliance with current Belgian standards. Safety, compliance and quality are at the heart of our priorities.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How to track an intervention?',
        answer: 'Each intervention is tracked via email or WhatsApp notifications. We are currently developing a dedicated client platform allowing real-time tracking with color-coded statuses (red / orange / green), request history and technical reports.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you have inventory and equipped vehicles?',
        answer: 'Yes. Each vehicle is equipped with a <strong>standardized inventory</strong> of common parts. For large sites, dedicated on-site storage space can also be considered in agreement with the client.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Do you provide detailed reporting?',
        answer: 'Yes. We provide <strong>before / during / after</strong> intervention reporting, with photos and technical recommendations. In case of deferred repair or necessary additional work, the client is immediately informed with full transparency.'
